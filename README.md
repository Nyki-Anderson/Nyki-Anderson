## ‚úàÔ∏è My Journey (so far...)

Greetings everyone! My name is Nyki Anderson, I am an undergraduate **Computer Science** major returning to my education after a seven-year hiatus following financial hardship and a lapse in overall direction. We all find ourselves at a crossroads in life, mine just occurred earlier than the proverbial mid-life crisis (notwithstanding the potential for one of those in the future). 

Despite changing majors several times in that time, I have always been a Bachelor of Science candidate: from math, computer science, atmospheric sciences, physics, and back to computer science I have always loved the hard sciences. And throughout my educational career I have had several distinct challenges and successes in those fields. I've had several NASA internships and presented various research projects at interdisciplinary symposiums, university colloquiums, and international conferences. All of which have characterized the kind of scientist I am becoming. 

At this point in my education, I intend to specialize in backend web development especially as it pertains to security. I interned with the COVA CCI Cybersecurity Research program in Spring of 2023 where I had my hands in Python's tensor libraries (PyTorch) training a neural network model to differentiate between arbitrary network traffic. As a proof of concept, this simple model substantiates the use of machine learning in detecting malicioius network traffic given the proper training dataset. You can review my [published research](https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/covacci-undergraduateresearch/2023spring/projects/8/) for this experience and/or request to view the source code as well.

I'm interested in the DevSecOps method of integrating security into every aspect of the development process. I've done extensive research on the topic and would be interested in working with any organization with such a culture. As such, I firmly believe in working closesly with penetration testers and so-called ethical hackers. In my hacking capacity at BugCrowd, I have a unique perspective as a programmer, which allows me to attack applications from angles other more cyber-oriented folks might not. 

While a fulltime courseload has me booked up lately, I am enrolled in the [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security) where I am learning penetration techniques: from SQL injection and XSS Dom attacks, to bruteforcing passwords with personally developed Python scripts. I employ OWASP's ZAP tool for site crawling and cascading repeater requests rather than use the industry favorite, BurpSuite. While I enjoy how slick Burp is, the Automation Framework in ZAP allows me to script my scans for more precise and targeted reports. I am thoroughly enjoying having my coding cake and eating it too!

## üõ† Current Projects

I am mostly self-taught. Throughout the break in my education I started and restarted various personal web application projects both from scratch and using the CodeIgniter framework. During the pandemic, I got the coding itch and started Shape_Search, and later, Shape-Share, simple image sharing platforms and forums. In both projects, I relied heavily on my fellow Github teachers and online tutorials (I'm still learning!) though my focus was exploring as much functionality as I could within one project.

### üìå [Shape_Search](https://github.com/Nyki-Anderson/shape_search)
Shape_Search is the first iteration of my shape[^1] themed web application projects.  It offers loads of features for members (free of course) including image upload, profile design, like/dislike, comment, search, and organize images into albums. Care was made to create and protect a safe-space for all ages including foul-language filters and active content moderation. While it was never meant to be deployed, it serves as an example of my coding interests and learning process. 

[^1]: Why shapes? So I could use images created in Paint and avoid copyright infringement.

### üìå [Shape-Share](https://github.com/Nyki-Anderson/shape-share)
Shape-Share is the product of my trial and error process but is essentially a refined clone of Shape_Search. The goal with this project, is to provide a Github-hosted reference for other beginner programmers who want to configure their localhost, secure their database, and other beginner struggles. It is intended to be an exercise in building secure websites and I'm mostly learning as I go. 

Its predecessor, is much more fleshed out as I used CodeIgniter to get up and going but I wanted to challenge myself to design without a framework catching all my mistakes. As such, its progression is much slower and the potential for security holes is high. I have enlisted the help of a student of penetration testing to aid in active security checks, which will likely continue through the lifetime of the project.
