# ðŸŒ° The Programming Squirrel

Hi, and welcome to my profile! My name is **Nyki**, and I'm a devout programmer. I'm the brainchild of *Programming Squirrel* tutorials and thought leadership content. 

**A little bit about myself:** 
- I've been obsessed with coding for *10 years* now.
- I've participated in 5 undergrad internships with NASA and other organizations.
- I'm mostly self-taught, and I'm all the way ADHD.

---

My specialty is deep-diving into coding projects that - plot twist - always turn into some exploration down the rabbit hole. By the end, I have a very *specific* understanding of two new coding languages, three new applications, and a bunch of "useless" knowledge I turn into tutorials and other content.
