# About Me
Greetings everyone! My name is Nyki Anderson, I am returning to my education after a seven-year hiatus following financial hardship and a lapse in overall direction. We all find ourselves at a crossroads in life, mine just occurred earlier than the proverbial mid-life crisis (notwithstanding the potential for one of those in the future). Despite changing majors several times in that time, I have always been a Bachelor of Science candidate: from math, computer science, atmospheric sciences, physics, and back to to computer science I have always loved the hard sciences. And throughout my educational career I have had several distinct challenges and successes in those fields. I've had several NASA internships, and presented various research subjects at interdisciplinary symposiums, 
university colloquiums, and international conferences. All of which have characterized the kind 
of scientist I am becoming.
